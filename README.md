# Fashion_MNIST_with_Keras
This notebook is created to solve the Fashion MNIST dataset. I've used Keras and Tensorflow to create a Sequential API that takes input a 28*28 pixel image from the dataset and predicts the class to which the image belongs. The model is tested to give almost 97% accuracy on the validation dataset. It also gives 87% accuracy on the test datasets.
